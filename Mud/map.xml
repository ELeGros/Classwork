			You are in a rusty old jail cell. It is dark, with the only real light coming from the crack
			underneath a large wooden door to the north. The smells of piss and decay mingle, creating a sickening
			aroma. As you contemplate these surroundings, you hear a set of footsteps, and decide that you should
			think fast; this is a dark place.
